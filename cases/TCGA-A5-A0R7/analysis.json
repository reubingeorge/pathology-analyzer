  "description": "Surgical pathology demonstrated a grade 2/3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus invading 40% of the myometrial thickness (Stage IA) with clear cervical and parametrial margins, no lymph-vascular space invasion, and negative pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes (pT1a pN0 M0).",
  "patient_notes": "Your surgery removed the uterus, tubes, and ovaries, and the report shows a type of uterine cancer that invaded less than half the muscle wall and did not spread to lymph nodes (Stage IA). Because the tumor is higher grade, we recommend an internal radiation treatment (vaginal brachytherapy) to the vaginal cuff and may add chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) to lower the risk of recurrence. This treatment plan targets any remaining cells while aiming to minimize side effects.",
