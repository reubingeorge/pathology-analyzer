  "description": "Surgical pathology of a total hysterectomy reveals a 5.2 cm FIGO grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma with 0.5 cm myometrial invasion (\u226450%), no lymph-vascular invasion, and negative lymph nodes (0/28). Pathologic staging is pT1a, pN0, with no distant metastasis identified.",
  "patient_notes": "Your surgery removed the uterine cancer, which was limited to the inner half of the uterine muscle and did not spread to your lymph nodes. This is considered an early stage (IA) cancer. Based on guidelines, additional treatment may be recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence, and your care team will discuss options such as radiation therapy. We will work together to plan the next steps for your care.",
