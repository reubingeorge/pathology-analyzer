  "description": "This surgical pathology report describes a 5.7 cm endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma, FIGO grade 2, with invasion of less than half the myometrium (0.2 cm of 1.7 cm), negative cervical and adnexal involvement, and no lymph node metastases (pT1a pN0). The specimen margins are uninvolved and lymphovascular invasion is indeterminate.",
  "patient_notes": "Your pathology report shows an early-stage endometrial cancer (stage IA) that was completely removed by surgery, and no cancer was found in the lymph nodes. Based on current NCCN guidelines, no further treatment is generally needed, though a low-dose vaginal radiation may be offered to reduce the risk of local recurrence. We will continue to follow you with regular visits and imaging to ensure your continued health and address any concerns.",
