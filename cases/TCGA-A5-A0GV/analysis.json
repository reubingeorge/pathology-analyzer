  "Description": "Pathology reveals a FIGO grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus with superficial myometrial invasion (<50%), negative cervical margins, and no lymph node or adnexal involvement.",
  "Patient Notes": "Your report shows a low-grade uterine cancer that was confined to the inner lining and only superficially invaded the muscle of your uterus. No cancer was found in the lymph nodes or other reproductive organs. Because it\u2019s a stage IA, grade 1 tumor, you have a very low risk of recurrence, and no additional treatment is needed beyond regular follow-up visits. We will schedule routine check-ups to monitor your health moving forward.",
