  "Description": "Pathology demonstrates a high-grade uterine serous adenocarcinoma (FIGO grade III) with >50% myometrial invasion and spread to the adnexa and peritoneum, corresponding to AJCC pathologic stage pT3a Nx.",
  "Patient Notes": "This report shows an aggressive form of uterine cancer called uterine serous carcinoma that has involved the muscle of the uterus and spread to nearby tissues. You have already undergone surgery to remove the uterus and ovaries. The next step recommended by guidelines is chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, and we may test for HER2 to see if a targeted drug can be added. Radiation therapy to the pelvis or vaginal area may also be offered to help reduce the chance of recurrence.",
