  "description": "Surgical pathology reveals a 14.0\u00d77.7 cm endometrial carcinoma with both endometrioid and undifferentiated components, showing >50% myometrial invasion and cervical stromal involvement. All lymph nodes and extrauterine sites are negative, corresponding to pT2b N0.",
  "patient_notes": "Your report shows a high-grade uterine cancer that grew into the muscle and the neck of the uterus but did not spread to lymph nodes. Because this is an aggressive subtype, we recommend additional treatment with chemotherapy along with pelvic radiation and a vaginal brachytherapy boost. This combined approach aims to eliminate any remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of recurrence. We will guide you through each step of your treatment plan.",

Medical inference validation identified issues: Subtype and staging are correct and consistent, but treatment should explicitly include chemotherapy, external beam radiation, and vaginal brachytherapy per NCCN for high\u2010grade stage II disease.",
