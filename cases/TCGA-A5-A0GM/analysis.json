  "Final Pathologic Stage": "pT1a N0 M0",
  "Recommended Treatment": "Observation (no adjuvant therapy) per NCCN guidelines for stage IA, grade 1 endometrioid carcinoma",
  "Description": "Surgical pathology reveals a primary endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus, FIGO grade 1, with less than 50% myometrial invasion, no lymphovascular or nodal involvement, consistent with FIGO stage IA.",
  "Patient Notes": "Your surgery removed a low-grade uterine cancer that was confined to the inner lining and has not spread to lymph nodes or other tissues. No additional treatment like radiation or chemotherapy is typically recommended for this very early-stage, low-risk cancer. We will monitor you closely with regular follow-up exams to ensure there is no recurrence.",
