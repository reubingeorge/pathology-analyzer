  "patient_notes": "You have a type of uterine cancer called endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The cancer was removed by surgery and was found to have only superficial invasion and some involvement of the fallopian tube. Your care team recommends chemotherapy and may add pelvic radiation and internal vaginal therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence. This approach aims to eliminate any remaining cancer cells and improve your outcome.",
