  "Recommended Treatment": "Observation; vaginal brachytherapy may be offered as an option per NCCN guidelines for low-risk stage IA, grade 1 endometrioid carcinoma",
  "Description": "The report documents a FIGO grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma confined to the uterus with minimal (<10%) myometrial invasion, no lymphovascular invasion, and no cervical, ovarian, or parametrial involvement. Although there is uncertain mucosal involvement of the right fallopian tube, the extent of disease remains consistent with stage IA.",
  "Patient Notes": "Your pathology shows a low-grade endometrial cancer that was removed completely with minimal invasion into the muscle layer and no spread to other pelvic structures. This places you in a very low-risk category, so additional treatment beyond surgery is typically not needed. We may offer a small internal radiation treatment (vaginal brachytherapy) to reduce any tiny remaining risk, but close follow-up and regular check-ups are the main plan. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns about this approach.",
