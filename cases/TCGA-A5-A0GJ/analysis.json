  "patient_notes": "The pathology report shows that the cancer was limited to the inner lining and only superficially into the muscle of the uterus, and no cancer was found in any lymph nodes. Because the tumor has a high\u2010risk clear cell component, we recommend a course of chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. You may also be offered a targeted form of vaginal radiation to lower the chance of the cancer coming back. These steps follow the NCCN guidelines for your specific stage and tumor type.",
