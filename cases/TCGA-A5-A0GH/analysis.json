  "patient_notes": "This report describes early-stage uterine cancer confined to the uterine lining and muscle wall, with no spread to lymph nodes or other tissues. A small focus of vessel involvement was noted, which increases the risk of recurrence. To reduce this risk, we recommend adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy, a targeted radiation treatment focused on the upper vagina.",
