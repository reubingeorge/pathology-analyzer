  "description": "Primary well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium measuring 5.2 cm with 56% myometrial invasion and lymphovascular invasion; surgical margins, cervix, and lymph nodes are negative.",
  "patient_notes": "Your report shows endometrial cancer confined to the uterus with no lymph node spread. The tumor invaded just over half of the uterine muscle and was removed completely. Because of vessel involvement, a targeted internal radiation treatment (vaginal brachytherapy) is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence.",

    "assessment": "All extracted fields are correct; staging is accurately determined as FIGO stage IB corresponding to pT1c pN0 pMx; treatment recommendation aligns with NCCN guidelines for stage IB with lymphovascular invasion present. Medical inference validation identified issues: 1. Subtype 'Endometrioid adenocarcinoma' is allowed. 2. 56% myometrial invasion defines FIGO IB and pT1b, not pT1c. 3. pN0 and pMx correctly reflect negative nodes and unknown metastasis. 4. Adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy is appropriate for intermediate\u2010risk stage IB, grade 1 with LVSI.",
