  "patient_notes": "The report shows a low-grade endometrial cancer that invaded about half of the uterine muscle but did not spread to lymph nodes or other organs. Your uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes were removed, and the lymph nodes were negative. Based on these findings, you may not need further treatment beyond regular monitoring. We will discuss any additional options according to guidelines to lower the risk of recurrence.",
