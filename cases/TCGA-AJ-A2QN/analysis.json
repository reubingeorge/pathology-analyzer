  "patient_notes": "The surgical pathology shows endometrial cancer that grew through most of the uterine wall and into the cervical tissue, but no cancer was found in the lymph nodes. To reduce the risk of recurrence, you will receive radiation to the pelvis along with targeted radiation inside the vagina. Because there are some high-risk features, we may also discuss adding chemotherapy to your treatment plan. We will review what to expect and support you through each step.",
