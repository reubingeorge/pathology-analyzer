  "Recommended Treatment": "Adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy per NCCN guidelines for stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma (grade 2, >50% myometrial invasion).",
  "Description": "Surgical pathology reveals a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus with deep (75\u201380%) myometrial invasion and no lymph node metastases, staged as pT1c pN0 (FIGO IC).",
  "Patient Notes": "Your pathology report shows endometrial cancer that was confined to the uterus and has not spread to lymph nodes. The tumor was grade 2 and invaded more than half of the uterine muscle wall. You have had a hysterectomy with removal of both ovaries and tubes. Based on current NCCN guidelines, we recommend adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy to reduce the risk of local recurrence.",
