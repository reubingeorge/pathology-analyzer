  "FIGO Stage": "IIIC1",
  "Final Pathologic Stage": "pT1a pN1 pM0",
  "Recommended Treatment": "Following total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, NCCN guidelines recommend adjuvant combined modality therapy for stage IIIC1 high-grade endometrioid carcinoma: external beam pelvic radiation therapy with or without vaginal brachytherapy plus systemic chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel).",
  "Description": "High-grade (grade 3) endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus measuring 5.0 cm with invasion of less than half the myometrium and negative margins; one of eleven right pelvic lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma (pT1a, pN1). No cervical, adnexal, or distant spread identified.",
  "Patient Notes": "Your pathology shows a high-grade uterine cancer that was confined to the uterus but spread to one pelvic lymph node. The surgery removed the uterus, ovaries, tubes, and nearby tissues with clear margins. Because a lymph node was involved, your care team recommends radiation to the pelvis (and possibly a vaginal boost) together with chemotherapy using carboplatin and paclitaxel. This combined approach is standard to reduce the risk of cancer returning.",
