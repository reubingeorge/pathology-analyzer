  "description": "High-grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with a 5 cm tumor, superficial myometrial invasion, negative cervical and adnexal involvement, and one metastatic pelvic lymph node, consistent with stage IIIC1 disease.",
  "patient_notes": "Your report shows endometrial cancer that was mostly confined to the uterus but spread to one lymph node, which is called stage IIIC1. The tumor was removed by surgery and involved less than half of the muscular layer of your womb. Experts recommend chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy to lower the chance of the cancer coming back. We will review these treatment options and support you through the process.",

Treatment recommendation aligns with NCCN guidelines for stage IIIC1 endometrial carcinoma. Medical inference validation identified issues: Staging and subtype are correct, but treatment should include both chemotherapy and EBRT per NCCN guidelines for stage IIIC1 disease.",
