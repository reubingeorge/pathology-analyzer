  "description": "Surgical pathology of a laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy reveals a mixed endometrioid (grade 2) and serous (grade 3) adenocarcinoma of the uterus, predominantly exophytic with less than 50% myometrial invasion (FIGO stage IA). No lymphovascular invasion or nodal metastases were identified.",
  "patient_notes": "Your pathology report shows a uterine cancer mostly composed of endometrial-type cells with a small high-grade component, and it is stage 1A, meaning it is confined to your uterus. Additional treatment with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) and a short course of targeted vaginal radiation will help lower the risk of the cancer coming back. No cancer was found in your lymph nodes. We will schedule and discuss these treatments to support your recovery.",

    "assessment": "The extracted FIGO stage IA and pathologic stage pT1a, pNX accurately reflect the reported <50% myometrial invasion and lack of nodal assessment. Treatment aligns with NCCN recommendations for mixed endometrioid/serous histology at stage IA. Medical inference validation identified issues: Mixed endometrioid (grade 2) with serous (grade 3) histology mandates serous carcinoma classification and nodal status described as negative supports pN0 staging rather than NX.",
