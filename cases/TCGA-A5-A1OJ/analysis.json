  "Cancer Organ Type": "Uterine cancer",
  "Cancer Subtype": "Endometrioid adenocarcinoma",
  "FIGO Stage": "Stage IA (FIGO grade 1)",
  "Final Pathologic Stage": "pT1a pN0 (AJCC Stage IA)",
  "Recommended Treatment": "Observation (no adjuvant therapy) per NCCN guidelines for Stage IA, low-risk endometrioid endometrial carcinoma",
  "Description": "Surgical pathology of a total hysterectomy revealed a primary low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma confined to the endometrium with <10% myometrial invasion, no lymphovascular invasion, and negative lymph nodes (pT1a pN0, Stage IA). The fallopian tubes, cervix, and parametrial tissues are free of tumor.",
  "Patient Notes": "Your surgery removed a low-grade uterine cancer that was confined to the lining of the uterus without any spread to lymph nodes, which corresponds to an early stage (IA). Because this is a low-risk tumor, no further treatments like chemotherapy or radiation are required at this time. We will monitor you with regular check-ups to ensure your continued health.",
