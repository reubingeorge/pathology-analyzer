  "patient_notes": "Your surgery showed endometrial cancer that invaded the uterine muscle less than halfway, spread to the cervix and an ovary, but did not involve the lymph nodes. This is classified as stage IIIA. The recommended treatment includes chemotherapy and may include focused radiation to the pelvis or vaginal area. We will guide you through each step and provide support throughout your treatment.",
