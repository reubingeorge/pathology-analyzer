  "Description": "The report documents a grade II endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus with less than 50% myometrial invasion, negative surgical margins, and no lymph node metastases (0/4). Pathologic staging is pT1b pN0 pM0 (FIGO IB).",
  "PatientNotes": "Your pathology report shows a moderate-grade uterine cancer that was confined to the inner half of the uterus and did not spread to nearby lymph nodes. Surgical margins are clear, meaning the tumor was completely removed. Based on these findings, you may not need additional chemotherapy; we may recommend targeted radiation (vaginal brachytherapy) to lower the chance of recurrence. We will discuss observation versus a brief course of vaginal radiation to best support your recovery.",
