  "patient_notes": "Your pathology shows a moderate-grade endometrial cancer that was confined to your uterus with no spread to lymph nodes or other organs (Stage IB). The tumor was completely removed and the surgical margins are clear. To reduce the chance of the cancer returning in the vaginal area, we recommend targeted radiation therapy inside the vagina (vaginal brachytherapy). This approach is effective and minimizes exposure to surrounding tissues.",

Grade 2 disease with negative margins and no lymphovascular invasion supports adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy per NCCN guidelines. Medical inference validation identified issues: Less than 50% myometrial invasion corresponds to FIGO stage IA and pT1a; IB and pT1b require invasion \u226550%.",
