  "description": "High\u2010grade (FIGO grade III), predominantly serous endometrial carcinoma with <50% myometrial invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and a microscopic focus in the left parametrium; all sampled lymph nodes are negative. There is a minor clear cell component and no metastatic involvement of ovaries, tubes, peritoneum, or nodes. ",
  "patient_notes": "Your pathology report shows a high\u2010grade uterine cancer called serous carcinoma that was mostly confined to the upper layers of the uterine muscle with no cancer found in the lymph nodes. Because this type carries a higher risk of return even at an early stage, the recommended next step is chemotherapy (a combination of two drugs given through an IV) plus a targeted form of internal radiation (vaginal brachytherapy) to help reduce the chance of recurrence. Please discuss scheduling these treatments and any questions with your care team.",
