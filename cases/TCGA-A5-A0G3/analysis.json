  "Description": "Surgical pathology demonstrates a 4.5 cm papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the uterus with deep (outer half) myometrial invasion, endocervical stromal involvement, lymphovascular invasion, and multiple positive regional lymph nodes, staged pT2b N1 Mx (FIGO IIC).",
  "Patient Notes": "The pathology report shows a high-grade serous cancer in the uterus that extended into the muscle layer and nearby lymph nodes. To reduce the chance of recurrence, you will receive chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, possibly with trastuzumab if your tumor is HER2-positive, along with targeted radiation to the pelvic area and vaginal cuff.",
