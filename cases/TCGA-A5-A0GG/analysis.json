  "patient_notes": "Your surgery removed the cancer, which was confined to the inner layer of the uterus and had not spread to lymph nodes or other tissues. This is an early stage tumor (Stage IA), and no additional treatment is needed at this time. We will monitor your recovery with regular follow-up visits and imaging to ensure the cancer does not return. Please let us know if you have any questions or new symptoms.",
