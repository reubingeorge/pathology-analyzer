  "patient_notes": "You have early-stage, low-grade uterine cancer that was fully removed and has not spread to lymph nodes. To reduce the risk of the cancer returning in the vagina, we recommend a targeted radiation treatment called vaginal brachytherapy. We will also schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor your health.",
