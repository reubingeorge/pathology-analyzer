  "description": "Pathology confirms endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma, FIGO grade 3, stage IA, with 36% myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space involvement, and endocervical mucosal extension; all lymph nodes are negative.",
  "patient_notes": "Your cancer was confined to the lining of the uterus and less than half of the muscle wall. The lymph nodes showed no cancer spread. Although this is a high-grade tumor, the surgery removed all visible disease. Additional treatment such as vaginal radiation may be considered to lower the risk of recurrence based on current guidelines.",
