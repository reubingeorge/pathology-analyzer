  "description": "The pathology report describes a FIGO grade III endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus with greater than 50% myometrial invasion and lymphovascular invasion, no cervical or nodal involvement, and no evidence of metastatic disease.",
  "patient_notes": "You have an endometrial (uterine) cancer that was removed by surgery, and the tumor invaded more than half of the uterine wall but did not spread to lymph nodes or other organs. Because of the depth of invasion and high tumor grade, additional treatment is recommended. The usual next steps include radiation therapy to the pelvis and inside the vagina, and possibly chemotherapy to lower the chance of the cancer coming back.",
