  "patient_notes": "Your report shows endometrial cancer that was confined to the inner lining of the uterus and removed completely by surgery. There was no spread to lymph nodes or other organs. Because the tumor was low risk, no additional treatment is needed at this time. We will follow you with routine check-ups to monitor your health.",
