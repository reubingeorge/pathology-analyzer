  "patient_notes": "The report shows a low-risk uterine cancer that was removed completely during surgery. The cancer was shallowly invasive and did not spread to your lymph nodes or other organs. Based on current guidelines, no further treatment is needed beyond regular check-ups. We will monitor you closely with follow-up visits to ensure everything remains clear.",
