  "Description": "A total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen revealed an endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma, FIGO grade II/III, with very superficial myometrial invasion (<20%) and no lymph node or distant metastases (pT1b, pN0, pM0).",
  "Patient Notes": "Your surgery removed an early-stage endometrial cancer confined to the inner lining of the uterus with very minimal invasion into the muscle layer and no lymph node involvement. The tumor was a common type of endometrial cancer called endometrioid adenocarcinoma and was graded as moderately to poorly differentiated. Because of the higher grade features, we recommend a localized vaginal brachytherapy treatment to lower the risk of recurrence in the vaginal cuff. No evidence of spread beyond the uterus means this is an early stage and the outlook is very favorable.",
