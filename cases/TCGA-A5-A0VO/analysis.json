  "patient_notes": "Your surgery removed the uterus and surrounding tissues, and the pathology showed a type of uterine cancer confined to the uterus with no spread to the lymph nodes. Because the cancer invaded more than half of the muscle layer, your care team may recommend follow-up treatments such as radiation therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence. We will work with you to review and discuss your personalized treatment plan and next steps.",
