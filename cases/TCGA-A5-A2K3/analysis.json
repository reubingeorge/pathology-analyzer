  "description": "High-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma favoring serous subtype was found confined to the endometrium with no myometrial invasion (pT1a), extensive lymphovascular space invasion, and negative lymph nodes (N0), resulting in FIGO stage IA (pT1a N0 Mx). Surgical margins and parametria are free of tumor.",
  "patient_notes": "This report shows a high-grade form of uterine cancer limited to the lining of the uterus with no spread to lymph nodes. All surgical margins are clear and no cancer was found in the removed lymph nodes. To reduce the risk of the cancer coming back, NCCN guidelines recommend chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel along with targeted radiation treatment inside the vagina. Your care team will discuss how to schedule these treatments and manage any side effects.",
