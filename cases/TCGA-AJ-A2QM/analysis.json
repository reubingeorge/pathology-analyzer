  "patient_notes": "The pathology report shows a high-grade type of uterine cancer that was confined to the inner muscle layer and had a small focus in the cervix. No cancer was found in the removed lymph nodes. Based on your stage, we recommend chemotherapy combined with targeted radiation to reduce the risk of recurrence. This combined approach is the standard first-line treatment after your surgery according to current guidelines.",
