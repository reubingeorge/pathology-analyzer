  "Description": "High-grade papillary serous carcinoma of the endometrium (4.5\u2009cm) with full-thickness myometrial invasion, cervical stromal involvement, a small ovarian focus, and nodal metastases (pT3a N2 M0, FIGO IIIC2). Six of 26 pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes were positive.",
  "Patient Notes": "This report describes a high-grade cancer of the uterine lining called serous endometrial carcinoma that has spread into the muscle wall of the uterus, the cervix, a tiny area of the ovary, and nearby lymph nodes. The cancer is classified as stage IIIC2, which means it has reached the lymph nodes above the pelvis. Treatment will involve surgery to remove the uterus and ovaries, followed by chemotherapy (a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel) and possibly targeted radiation to reduce the chance of the cancer returning.",
