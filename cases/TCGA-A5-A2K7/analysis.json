  "patient_notes": "Your pathology report shows a low-grade uterine cancer that has spread into the muscle of the uterus and the tissue of the cervix but has not spread to lymph nodes. You\u2019ve already had surgery to remove the uterus and ovaries. Because of the depth of invasion and blood vessel involvement, the recommended next step is targeted radiation therapy to the pelvis, which may include a small internal radiation boost, to help reduce the risk of the cancer returning.",
