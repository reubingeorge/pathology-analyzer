  "patient_notes": "The report shows a well-differentiated uterine cancer that invaded through the uterine muscle into the cervix but did not spread to lymph nodes. You have already had surgery and the next step is radiation therapy to the pelvis with possible internal radiation (brachytherapy). This treatment aims to destroy any remaining cancer cells and reduce the chance of recurrence. We will support you through each part of your treatment.",
