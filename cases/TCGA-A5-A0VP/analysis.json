  "patient_notes": "The report shows a high\u2010grade cancer of the lining of your uterus that is small and has not spread beyond the uterus or to lymph nodes (Stage IA). You have already had surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, tubes, and ovaries. To lower the chance of cancer returning, the team recommends targeted radiation delivered inside the vagina (vaginal brachytherapy). Your care team will discuss scheduling and any side effects to watch for.",
