  "description": "Surgical pathology of a hysterectomy specimen reveals a 5.0\u00d72.7 cm grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with 0.7 cm myometrial invasion (2.8 cm thickness), focal lymphovascular invasion, negative cervical, serosal, parametrial margins, and negative pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes (pT1a pN0, FIGO IA).",
  "patient_notes": "Your report shows a high-grade endometrial cancer confined to the inner layer of the uterus, with no cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes. We recommend a targeted internal radiation treatment (vaginal brachytherapy) to lower the chance of recurrence. This treatment is well tolerated and focuses radiation where it\u2019s most needed. Participation in a clinical trial is also an option you may discuss with your care team.",
