  "patient_notes": "Your report shows an early-stage uterine cancer confined to the inner layer of the uterus without spread to lymph nodes or surrounding structures. The tumor was completely removed with surgery, and all surgical margins are clear. Because this is a higher-grade tumor, we recommend targeted vaginal radiation (brachytherapy) to lower the chance of recurrence. This treatment focuses on the upper part of the vagina and helps protect healthy tissues.",
