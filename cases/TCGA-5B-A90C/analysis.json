  "patient_notes": "Your surgery removed a low-grade cancer confined to the lining of the uterus and showed no spread to lymph nodes or other tissues. This is an early stage (Stage IA) cancer with a very good prognosis. Based on guidelines, you may only need careful follow-up or a small targeted radiation treatment to the vaginal cuff. We will discuss these options and support you through monitoring and any additional care as needed.",
