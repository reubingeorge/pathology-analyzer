  "description": "Endometrioid adenocarcinoma grade 2 with less than half myometrial invasion and no lymph node involvement corresponds to FIGO stage IA (pT1a pN0). The patient underwent hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and margins and nodes are negative.",
  "patient_notes": "Your report shows a grade 2 endometrial cancer confined to the upper wall of the uterus with no lymph node spread. You have had surgery to remove the uterus and ovaries with no remaining cancer. Given the low stage, we will monitor you closely and may recommend a small internal vaginal radiation treatment to lower the chance of recurrence. Follow-up visits and imaging will be scheduled regularly.",
