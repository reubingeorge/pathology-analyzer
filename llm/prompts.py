This is a reasoning task that requires careful analysis and step-by-step thinking:

STEP 1: Read the pathology report carefully, identifying key medical terms and findings.
STEP 2: Determine the primary organ affected by selecting EXACTLY from the provided organ types list.
STEP 3: Identify the specific subtype of cancer by selecting EXACTLY from the provided subtypes list for that organ.
STEP 4: Search for all staging information, including:
  - Direct mentions of FIGO stages
  - TNM classification details
  - Descriptions of invasion depth, spread, or metastasis
  - Measurements that inform staging
STEP 5: Compare the findings to the provided NCCN guidelines, matching the specific cancer type and stage.
STEP 6: Determine the recommended treatment options STRICTLY based on the NCCN guidelines.
STEP 7: Formulate a professional medical summary for healthcare providers.
STEP 8: Create a patient-friendly explanation that is compassionate yet accurate.

After completing all reasoning steps, provide your complete answer in the requested JSON format with NO additional text.

For the given pathology report, extract the following information with great attention to detail:

1. Cancer Organ Type: Identify the specific organ affected from our database list above.
   - RESTRICTION: Choose EXACTLY ONE of these organ types: {organ_types}
   - You MUST ONLY select from this list, with exact spelling and capitalization
   - If truly not determinable, use EXACTLY "Not specified"

2. Cancer Subtype: Identify the specific subtype of cancer within that organ.

   - You MUST ONLY select from the subtypes listed in our database for that organ
   - Use EXACTLY the spelling and capitalization as provided in the subtypes list
   - If truly not determinable, use EXACTLY "Not specified"

3. FIGO Stage: Extract the FIGO staging information if present. Look for:
   - Any mentions of "FIGO" followed by stage numbers/letters
   - Words like "stage" followed by Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV) with possible subdivisions (A, B, C)
   - Explicit statements about depth of invasion, myometrial invasion, or serosal involvement
   - If not explicitly stated but inferable from pathologic details, provide the inferred FIGO stage
   - If FIGO staging cannot be determined, use EXACTLY "Not specified"

   - TNM notation like "pT1a", "pT2", "pN0", "pN1", "pM0", etc.
   - Tumor size measurements with T-classification
   - Lymph node status
   - If pathologic stage cannot be determined, use EXACTLY "Not specified"

5. Recommended Treatment: Based STRICTLY on NCCN guidelines for the identified cancer type and stage.
   - Be derived EXCLUSIVELY from current NCCN guidelines provided, not from general knowledge
   - Match the specific cancer type, stage, and any additional factors identified in the report
   - Be as specific as possible given the information available
   - If insufficient information to determine treatment, use EXACTLY "Not specified"

6. Description: Write a brief 1-2 sentence professional summary of the document.
   - Use appropriate medical terminology
   - Be specific about findings
   - Keep this concise and factual

7. Patient Notes: Write 2-4 patient-friendly sentences explaining this document.
   - Use simple, non-technical language
   - Be compassionate but factual
   - Explain what the findings mean for the patient
   - Include a mention of the recommended treatment approach

IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be STRICTLY in the JSON format specified with NO additional text.

   - Verify the cancer subtype is correctly selected FROM THE ALLOWED OPTIONS ONLY
   - If incorrect, select the correct subtype ONLY from the allowed options

3. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATION VERIFICATION:
